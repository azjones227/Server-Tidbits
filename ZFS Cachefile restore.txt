In this situation, I mistakenly ran my server without all of the ZFS drives properly plugged in.
This resulted in my zpool.cache file being corrupted. Every boot i had to use zfs mount -a, before i could fire up any LXC containers or QEMU virtual machines.
With some help from my mentor, William Mantly, and some googling I was able to find a solution.
This solution comes from forums.proxmox.com. I wholeheartedly reccommend you become familiar, especially when first starting out.

zpool set cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache <poolname>
this command will set the cachefile to its default location and also restores the file if it has been corrupted.

update-initramfs -k all -u
this command is to make sure that the system now knows about where the cachefile is located. It is a very powerful command with more uses than just this, but this is the command i needed at the time.

reboot
after the reboot, proxmox was able to function as normally with all of my autostarts working as intended.

Thanks for reading!
