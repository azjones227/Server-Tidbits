# Server-Tidbits
Just some stuff that i learned while homelabbing.

Each time i run into something interesting i will try to write about it here. This serves a dual purpose. One, it allows me to self reinforce what ive learned. Two, if someone else comes across the challenges I've faced, i sincerely hope they might find some help in these pages.

Special Thanks
