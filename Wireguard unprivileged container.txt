Before you attempt to install and run wrieguard on an lxc container, you must first prepare the kernel of the host system.

Step 1: Add "unstable" to your list of sources
     echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unstable-wireguard.list
     printf 'Package: *\nPin: release a=unstable\nPin-Priority: 90\n' > /etc/apt/preferences.d/limit-unstable
     apt update
     
Step 2: Download and install the package "pve-headers" (I assume you are using the proper repos, or you know how to use them.)(Please be advised, wireguard will not install properly without pve-headers installed)
     apt-get install pve-headers

Step 3: Install wireguard (This can be combined with step 2, by using both package names in the install command)
     apt-get install wireguard

Step 4: Test to see the the installation completed successfully (If successful, the terminal should dump you to another prompt with no errors)
     modprobe wireguard

Step 5: Add wireguard to the list of modules that load at boot time
     echo "wireguard" >> /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
     
Step 6: Create your LXC container
     Proxmox offers several methods to accomplish this, I defer to your judgement on how you proceed. I used Ubuntu 20 as my container OS because wireguard is built in to the kernel on this version. (Thanks WMantly)

Step 7: Install wireguard user space tools inside the unprivileged container(in ubuntu 20, please refer to the referenced tutorial if you are not using ubuntu 20)
     apt-get install --no-install-recommends wireguard-tools
     
Step 8:
